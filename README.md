## Database Structure

- verified_user_display_name: Display name at time of verification
- verifier_user_id: Discord user ID of verifier
- verifier_username: Verifier's display name
- timestamp: ISO timestamp of verification
- guild_id: Server ID for multi-server support
- additional_data: Optional notes (verbose logging)
```

### Settings Table
```sql
- guild_id: Server ID (primary key)
- log_channel_id: Configured log channel
- verbose_logging: Boolean for detailed logging
```

## Logging Outputs

- **Standard format**: `[timestamp] VERIFICATION: DisplayName (userID) verified by VerifierName (verifierID)`
- **Verbose format**: Includes additional notes and metadata
- **Automatic rotation**: New file each day

### 3. Database Persistence
Permanent SQLite storage for:
- Complete audit trail
- Statistics generation
- Historical analysis
- Multi-server support
